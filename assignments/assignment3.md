#### Assignment 3

1. Using the AND, OR and NOT functions create two functions ADD and CARRY that can add two numbers (bits). So the table for the two functions will look like this:

A | B | ADD | CARRY |
---------------------
0 | 0 | 0   | 0     |
0 | 1 | 1   | 0     |
1 | 0 | 1   | 0     |
1 | 1 | 0   | 1     |
