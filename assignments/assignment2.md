### Assignment 2

1. Given the cost-price (cp) and the selling-price (sp) as input, write a function to calculate the profit from the sale.

2. Given the amount of money borrowed (p), the rate of interest (r) and the time period in years (t) for which the money is borrowed</br>
write a function to calculate the total amount of money to be paid back. 

3. Write a javascript function to reverse the digits of a 4 digit positive integer. For example, if the input is 5129, the output should be 9215.<br/>
(Hint: There is a % operator like +,-,\*, and \/. The % operator is used like this - 5129 % 10 gives 9 (the last digit). )

4. Calculate the angle between the minute-hand and the hour-hand of a clock, given the time as hours (hh) and minutes (mm)

5. Suppose you are given the maths scores of 5 of your friends. You want to know how much their marks vary compared to the maximum score.<br/>
For e.g. if the scores are {50, 80, 90, 60, 50} then, the maximum is 90. Then the changes in marks are {90-50,90-80,90-90,90-60,90-50}.<br/>
which is {40, 10, 0, 30, 40}. The average of these numbers is (40+10+0+30+40)/5 = 30. This means, on an average, your friends scored 30 marks<br/> 
less than the highest amongst them. <br/><br/>
Now, you have to write a function that takes those 5 marks of the friends as input and calculates this average mark difference compared to the
highest amongst them.<br/>
(Hint: You may have to create 2 functions and call one from the other, or you can use maths to modify it into a single function).
