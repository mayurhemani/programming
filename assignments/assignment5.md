### Assignment 5 - Simple HTML

1. Create an HTML file where you present a school report-card of a student. The following information must be included along with labels:
* Name
* Class
* Science Score
* Mathematics Score
* English Score
* Second language Score
* Total Score


2. Create an HTML file with a single DIV in the body of the page:
```
<div class="thething">HTML</div>
```
Your job is to make this appear at the center of the window. You can get the width of the window using ``window.innerWidth`` and the height using ``window.innerHeight``. Use javascript to do this centering using the ``<script>``  tag.

One thing you will need to use is this.. to set the position of the element to aparticular value (say x, y), you have to do this:
```
objectToBePositioned.style.left = x + "px";
objectToBePositioned.style.top = y + "px";
```
where x and y are the variables containing the position values.
Challenging.. but try it.
